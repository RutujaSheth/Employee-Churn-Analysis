**Employee Churn Analysis**
Employee churn focuses on whether employee will leave or stay in the organization. 
Employee churn  will be affected by age, tenure, pay, job satisfaction, working conditions, growth potential and many other factors. In some cases employee with niche skills are harder to replace. It affects ongoing work and productivity of existing employees. Acquiring new employees has its costs such as hiring cost and training cost. Also, the new employee will take time to learn skills at similar level of technical or business expertise knowledge of an older employee. Organizations tackle this problem by applying machine learning techniques to predict employee churn, which helps them in taking necessary actions. 
It helps in designing better retention plans and improving employee satisfaction. data science algorithms can predict the future churn.

In this project, I have retrieved the data from database and indetified challenges present in the data. Performed data preprocessing, EDA and feature engineering. Built ML models, evaluated the models and finalized the best one. The final model created has an accuracy of 97% with 0.97 precision and 0.93 recall.
